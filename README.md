# ABControls
The ABControls project's purpose is to provide various iOS controls within a reusable framework.

In the decade I've been writing iOS apps for clients I've wirtten dozens of custom UI elements from special labels to
barcode readers, to simple signature capture elements.  I thought, why not take some of the things i've learned in this 
time and put together some UI controls that would both speed my development and more importantly hopefully help others 
to learn how to create their own controls.

My hope is that others will contribute to this.

All of the controls support @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable - so they will render within InterfaceBuilder.
